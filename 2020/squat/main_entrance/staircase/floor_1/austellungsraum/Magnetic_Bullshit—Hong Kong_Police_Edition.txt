Referencing the popular writing aid Magnetic Poetry, Magnetic Bullshit— Hong Kong Police Edition is a fridge magnet kit featuring the 300+ most popular words gleaned from over 120 Hong Kong police press conference transcripts since August 2019. While the press conferences are mostly conducted in Cantonese, Chinese state-owned news channel had uploaded videos on YouTube with English simultaneous interpretation. 
The artist then used a command-line program to scrape the automatic captions to compile a 627-page source text. While the compiled text is not perfect, there is a parallel between a machine-generated text and an authoritarian narrative. 
Participants could start any sentences with “Hong Kong Police”. You can freely can create your interpretation of the police’s narrative, reveal your version of truth, or even “receive” an apology.
