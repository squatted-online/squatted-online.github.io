__Embassy 🎪 for [the wrong digital art biennale 2020](http://thewrong.org)
reflecting on the possibilities of squatting digital spaces__

## Abstract

Back in 2003, Steven Johnson (1) highlighted some of the major aspects of the internet by describing it as a city. Indeed, the web has been built and experienced by many people; wide participation has fueled its growth, yet this interconnection is cordoned into parts, each retaining its own independence. If we look closer at the form of the internet, and analyse it through an architectural lens, it’s possible to make a comparison between the building of a city and the building of a website. Not only because both are accessible with an address, but because each “building” is capable of conveying a story: be it cultural, historical, or economical. Nevertheless, since the dimension of the internet’s growth is exponential, its spaces have been organized in a strict, hierarchical structure of surveillance and control. Social media, for example, has become comprised of an infinite news feed ruled by algorithms that alienate users into their own filter bubbles. For this reason, algorithms on social media, or any other kind of tracking algorithms, act as a reminder that the promise of a free internet has evolved into a powerful surveillance tool. Each step we take in the digital world results in a behavioral analysis used to better match advertising to the character of the user: a form of exploitation often referred to as data harvesting or immaterial labour (2).

Similarly, in urban spaces, we often find politically driven exploitation and tracking of citizens. Here, such positions are often the trigger for actions of protest that culminate in the act of squatting: the illegal occupation of buildings, with the aim to subvert the hierarchy by reshaping their structures to accommodate art, counterculture and politics, and to re-appropriate social time (3). Because of its self-organized and autonomous nature, squats have become forms of ephemeral architecture in which the internal spaces change according to the needs of its inhabitants, and to the social and cultural initiatives that are taking place in it; offering an alternative to neoliberal logic.

In the context of The Wrong 2019 we invite participating artists to takethe possibility of squatting a digital space into consideration. As offline and online words have similar characteristics — for instance The Million Dollar Homepage (4) echoes the rumble of Delirious New York (5) – the lust of The City’s grid is not too far from the desire to fool the internet starting from just a pixel. Therefore, we open a call for the first Basel’s Offline Embassy, inviting artists, coders, designers, and thinkers to re-imagine the website as a possible space to squat.

## PROGRAM 🗓

### [Keck Kiosk](https://www.keck-kiosk.ch) 21/2 – 1/3

#### Cybersquat

21/2 – 27/2<br>
by @_pitscher
 
For one week the artist @_pitscher will occupy the Keck Kiosk in Basel. His computer and phone screen will be projected to the outside of the house, while a webcam streams the inside to the internet. While working on digital projects and daily tasks, the visitors are allowed to watch him through windows™. People are encouraged to get in contact with the artist online or offline and start spontaneous collaborations. This could range from drinking tea to creating a personal VR space for their dog.

#### Bemused 90.63% (Don’t use maps ask for directions)

28/2 – 1/3<br>
by [La Scuola Open Source](http://www.lascuolaopensource.xyz) 
 
"Contemplating ruins is not a journey through history, but an experience of time, of pure time. As for the past, history is too rich, too multiple and too deep to be reduced to the stone mark that emerged, a lost object like those found by archaeologists digging their slices of space-time. As for the present, the emotion is of aesthetic order, but the spectacle of nature is combined with that of the vestiges".
 
"Ruins exist through the gaze that rests upon them. But between their multiple pasts and their lost functionality, what one perceives of them is a kind of time outside of history to which the individual contemplating them is sensitive as if it were helping him to understand the duration that flows in him".
 
Bemused 90.63% as an experimental journey is possible thanks to the creation of an open-source extension that modifies website navigation.
The extension has a certain probability of modifying the web pages visited by the user, redirecting all clickable links to a random selection of disused sites. Once this happens, the user begins a journey through these forgotten internet pages, which are altered by CSS transformations to emphasize their decay. To give a sense of this journey, a drunken Virgil: a red text box appears in superimposition on each site, containing quotes from various sources on issues such as getting lost, the internet, surveillance.
