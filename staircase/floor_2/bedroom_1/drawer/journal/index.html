        <h1>This diary belongs to @pitscher</h1>
        <p>As part of the <a href="https://squatted.online">squatted.online</a> exhibition during <a href="https://thewrong.org/">THE WRONG</a> Biennale I am squatting the <a href="https://www.keck-kiosk.ch/">Keck Kiosk</a> in Basel. My intention is to work on whatever I have to work on and have screens that show passengers on the street what I am doing on my computer and laptop. A livestream will be installed in the booth for people online to interact with me. <br>
        For the duration of my stay I will write about my experiences in this journal...</p>

        <h1>Day 0</h1>
        <p>
            I arrived at 15:15 in Basel. My suitcase and backpack is full with stuff that I collected at home and might need for the next couple of days. But I forgot my sleeping bag. <br>
            I am supposed to meet Yann at the Critical Media Lab...
            <br>
            <br>
            He was busy, so I went to the exhibition at H3K and went through the magazines in the library. Neither of which were really interesting for the upcoming week.
            <br>
            Together we went to the city, to go to Arianna‘s where I will sleep tonight. Her house is amazing and very close to the kiosk. If it's too cold at Keck I can always go back and ask to sleep at the house. They have their key in a lock outside. The code is 6572.
            <br>
            I left my luggage at the house and we inspected the kiosk. It is located in a nice area, next to a little park as part of the cultural district "Kaserne". The inside is big enough to put a 90cm mattress and have some table space to work. I'm curious if I can make it a bit more cozy in there.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yann went home and I went back to Arianna‘s place. I will hang out here for a while and have a shower. Later I will meet Andrea, the other organizer of squatted.
            <br>
            Andrea picked me up at home and we went for beer and met with Yann at a restaurant. Great Pizza! Y left early and A and me went for another drink to a bar that had a tiny dancefloor in the back. After moving a bit to music we got bored and left. We took the key to the kiosk before we went home.
            At the house I got another schnapps from my temporary housemates and went to bed.

        <h1>Day 1</h1>
        <p>
            I woke up around 9 but couldn't get up for the first 50 minutes. Not used to drinking anymore... I was supposed to meet A at 10 at the Kiosk. Got there around 10:15, but he was late, too. Good, it's not only me who takes this whole thing kinda slow.
            <br>
            When he arrived, we went to a café first, sat down in the sun and discussed the plan for today.
            <br>
            At some point we will go to Germany to do some shopping. Maybe I will stop by in Weil where my brother used to live.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tee
         </li>   <li>Müsli
       </li>     <li>Hafermilch
  </li>          <li>Öl
          </li>  <li>Kaffeebohnen
</li>            <li>Herdplatte
  </li>          <li>Bier/schnapps</li>
            <li>Taschentücher</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            After I came back from my shopping tour I went to the <a href="https://www.brocanthaus.com/">brocanthaus</a> on the opposite site of the street. I asked if I could borrow some TVs and an electric heater. After an initial hesitation the owner was very nice, so I gave him a 200 Franken deposit for those 3 things.
            <br>
            I cleaned my new home a bit and started to set up the router and TVs. I wanted to get the raspberry pi running over which the livestream will be constantly running.
            <br>
            When A came and brought me some blankets and a pillow I couldn't connect to the pi over ssh. Maybe it is using the same IP of one of the other connected devices? I will try to fix it tomorrow. <br> <br>
            Y came with his modular synthesizer and we plugged him into the mixer and to one PA speaker that was already part of the kiosk.
            The sound quality of this setup was horrible, but we still had a lot of fun dancing alone in front of the booth. Two friends came by to drink some Rotkäpchen Sekt and we managed to stop some passengers on the street who were wondering. All in all a really nice housewarming party. Ahh, I also had a chat with two interesting characters on the street. First I met Mattheo, who seemed kind of lost. He is a carpenter and is filing a patent for wooden bike, which is why he went to Bern today. There he went through the process of finding similiar patents. The worker, a chinese-swiss, said that he has a folder with very strange patents and that some day he wants to make a book out of it. I gave Mattheo my card, so he can give my e-mail to the guy from the patent buero.
            <br>
            Then I met Stephan, who said he was a dancer. He made an instrument out of an alpine horn and suggested that we could play a bit at the kiosk. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We just went to a food court close by and ate a Sabich. Really good! Now we are back at the kiosk to play a bit more music and drink some beers. Then I will have my first night here...

        <h1>Day 2</h1>
        <p>
            I slept long, even though people outside were quite loud during the night. I feel a bit groggy from all those beers last night. I guess I will take it slow today.
            <br>
            I managed to set up the two TVs and am streaming my computer to the left display and my phone to the right. People don't really seem to care about my presence in the kiosk. The weather is sunny and I have my door wide open.
            <br>
            The owner of the restaurant <a href="https://www.parterre-one.ch/de/gastronomie/one-essen-trinken/bbq-brunch">Parterre One</a> next to me just apologized for the smoke, as they were making a BBQ. He invited to me have some food and a got an amazing plate of smoked salmon, ribs, steak and potatoes.
            <br>
            I watched some random youtube videos. One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK61pD_ySeU">documentary</a> about the U-Bahn in Vienna. It's called Alltagsgeschichten and I really enjoy the format. Maybe I should do something similar here. The producer just walks around and interviews random people, follows an elderly woman who is completely lost and talks to the youth. <br>
            I watched John Oliver about the president in India.
            <br>
            <br>
            I managed to connect to my raspberry and the stream to twitch is working well. I am trying to stream to facebook, but somehow that doesn't work. I think it has something to with the encrypted stream they require.
            <br>
            I'm live! Some of my friends from uni joined the chatroom and shared my performance on social media.
            A friend from Cologne joined the chatroom and I realized I wanted to talk to him since December. <br>
            <a href="https://cnrd.computer/">Cnrd</a> is a great young artist/programmer/designer and we talked for almost an hour about a project that I am working on with some friends from Berlin. We want to redesign the <a href="https://fullyfunded-residencies.weebly.com/">fully funded residencies</a> platform. The idea is to create an inclusive space for people to find opportunities to go abroad. During our discussion he brought up another idea of reversing the situation for artists. Instead of applying for exhibitions and residencies it would be nice to have a platform for curators to explore art that is not part of the mainstream. Definitely something to keep on examining. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For the past 2 hours I was mindlesly scrolling the internet, time to go to bed.

        <h1>Day 3</h1>
        <p>
            Got up early today. It's even more sunny than yesterday. I had porrage for breakfast. Big amount. Made some coffee and am watching the news now. 
            <br>
            Coronavirus in Italy. Elections in Hamburg, not a lot of far right voters. Greens got a 15% boost from last election. Christian Democrats lost a big amount of voters. 
            <br>
            Stephan passed by and we talked about another project he wants to realize. He wants to make a radio play about a refugee from Prussia, who left the country when he was 6, but never talked about his experience until he was 80 years old. But the audio should not be linear. He wants to randomize the story, so every time someone listens to you get to know something different. Sounds like an easy thing to do in the web. S invited for lunch later, which I gladly take.
