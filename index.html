      <h2 style="font-family: 'pixel', monospace; text-align: center; color: #f00"><span>Squatting the
          Internet</span></h2> <br>

      <p>Back in 2003, Steven Johnson <a href="#1">[1]</a> highlighted some of the major aspects of the internet by
        describing it as a city. Indeed, the web has been built and experienced by many people; wide participation has
        fueled its growth, yet this interconnection is cordoned into parts, each retaining its own independence. If we
        look closer at the form of the internet, and analyse it through an architectural lens, it‚Äôs possible to make a
        comparison between the building of a city and the building of a website. Not only because both are accessible
        with an address, but because each ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù is capable of conveying a story: be it cultural, historical, or
        economical. Nevertheless, since the dimension of the internet‚Äôs growth is exponential, its spaces have been
        organized in a strict, hierarchical structure of surveillance and control. Social media, for example, has become
        comprised of an infinite news feed ruled by <i>algorithms</i> that alienate users into their own <i>filter
          bubbles</i>. For this reason, algorithms on social media, or any other kind of tracking algorithms, act as a
        reminder that the promise of a free internet has evolved into a powerful surveillance tool. Each step we take in
        the digital world results in a behavioral analysis used to better match advertising to the character of the
        user: a form of exploitation often referred to as <i>data harvesting</i> or <i>immaterial labour</i> <a
          href="#2">[2]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, in urban spaces, we often find politically driven exploitation and tracking of citizens. Here, such
        positions are often the trigger for actions of protest that culminate in the act
        of
        squatting: the illegal occupation of buildings, with the aim to subvert the hierarchy by reshaping their
        structures to accommodate art, counterculture and politics, and to <i>re-appropriate social time</i> <a
          href="#3">[3]</a>. Because of its
        self-organized and autonomous nature, squats have become forms of ephemeral architecture in which the
        internal spaces change according to the needs of its inhabitants, and to the social and cultural
        initiatives that are taking place in it; offering an alternative to neoliberal logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of <a href="https://thewrong.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrong 2019</a>
        <a href="https://basel.codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we</a> invite participating artists
        to takethe possibility of squatting a digital space into consideration. As offline and online words have similar
        characteristics ‚Äî for instance <i>The Million Dollar Homepage</i>
        <a href="#4">[4]</a> echoes
        the rumble of <i>Delirious New York</i> <a href="#5">[5]</a> ‚Äì the lust of The City‚Äôs grid is not too far from
        the desire to fool the
        internet starting from just a pixel. Therefore, we open a call for the first Basel‚Äôs Offline Embassy, inviting
        artists, coders, designers, and thinkers to re-imagine the website as a possible space to squat.
      </p>
      <br> <br>
      <p class="highlight" style="text-indent: 0px;">Submissions may address the following questions:
        What are the implications of a digital squat? How could forms of self-organization emerge between different
        users working on the same source code? Will the digital squat survive or collapse over internal tensions? What
        will this digital space be‚Äîa library, an art gallery, or a host to a concert or maybe a screening? Will the
        squatter organize a ‚Äúdigital march?‚Äù

      </p>
      <br> <br>

      <p style="text-indent: 0px;">
        Considering the internet as a country and websites its own buildings, candidates will be asked to squat our
        website, to transform and reshape it, to collaborate and debate, to build and destroy, or maybe to extend the
        squat to new domains.
      </p>

        about
