        <p>
            After more than 18 months of quarantines and pandemic, we are pleased to open a new call for the SQUATTED.ONLINE exhibition; this year the topic is RAVE!
        </p>
        <p>
            The topic came with ease as we can't wait to shake our bums to high paced music and glowing lights. Therefore, this year we ask all the participants to submit a digital artwork, a musical performance, a track, a lecture or an essay, dealing with the topic of RAVE. We don't care whether you are generation Z raver or a good old raver from the late 80's what we want is at least 140 bpm of heavy beats either literally or metaphorically represented in the medium of your choice.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Stay tuned with us as we might also be able to provide space for streamed and live performances.
        </p>
