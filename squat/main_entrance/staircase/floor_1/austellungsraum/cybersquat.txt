For one week the artist @_pitscher will occupy the Keck Kiosk in Basel. His computer and phone screen will be projected to the outside of the house, while a webcam streams the inside to the internet. While working on digital projects and daily tasks, the visitors are allowed to watch him through windowsâ„¢. People are encouraged to get in contact with the artist online or offline and start spontaneous collaborations. This could range from drinking tea to creating a personal VR space for their dog.
